# Taky

<h3>Problem we project to solve</h3>
<p>Everyone during this lockdown has seen what does mean being queued up. Haven’t you?</br>
Waiting hours in line gave us time to think about how to improve this situation.</br>
SMEs are facing several troubles that will remain in the next future.</br>
Some of them are overloaded with people outside their doors, while others are still not allowed to be opened.</br>
Both of them are struggling to maintain their business as a consequence of social distancing and the other restrictions.
It also may happen to be full in specific hours while, shortly after, being empty.</p>
<p>In this scenario Taky aims to be the solution!</p>

<h3>What is the solution we bring to the table</h3>
<p>Taky is a platform which can be used via mobile app or browser. It provides a marketplace where SMEs can sell products, allowing the customers to choose a time slot in which they would be able to collect their products directly to the shop.<br/>  
Taky provides an easy way to book time slots, allowing SMEs to keep working respecting imposed restrictions and/or to reduce the queues.<br/>
Time slots are intended to be flexible according to the seller strategy.</p>
<p>Using the time slot feature SMEs are also able to provide services, for example:<br/>
the seller sets on Taky time slots in which they can serve buyers and settings how many people can be served in the same slot.<br/>
The customer finds a nearby store, buys some products and chooses an available time slot. The system will notify the request and assign the slot to the customer. 
</p>
<p>Taky can be used to sell services as well as goods. SMEs can use Taky to manage appointments with the time slot agenda allowing them to sell their services.</p>

<h3>The solution’s impact to the crisis</h3>
<p>Taky was thinked as a concrete and valid solution to ease the customers as well as SMEs. On one side it is the key to reduce queues, situations in which the corona might spread; On the other side Taky wants to help sellers to manage and digitize their business. It does not forget business which sells only services and not physical products. Due to the technologies chosen it is fast to be implemented and easily scalable. Taky is designed to use its versability in order to not leave behind any SME.</p> 
<p>Taky is designed to not live behind  SMEs who.</p>

<p>The key sentence is: “The uniforming of requests”. A single marketplace platform can distribute requests for goods or services of the various shops in the area.The result of this will therefore be fewer queues and a uniform customer number for stores of the same type.<br/>
This will make it easier to: 
<ul>
<li>Apply the rules on social distancing to fight against covid-19.</li> 
<li>Give visibility to companies and businesses left out with few customers</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>The necessities in order to continue the project</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Given the magnitude of the problem it will surely take 2 months of work to complete the development.</li>
<li>Buy an online server for the test period of the application.</li>
<li>Maintain the application with upgrades and customer service.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Value of the solution after the crisis</h3>
<p>Once the crisis is over, using Taky will still have its advantages. In fact, it will remain an excellent tool for digital transformation of SMEs. It is an easy-to-use tool to increase productivity and give a great opportunity of local visibility. Last but not least it keeps helping SMEs to manage their business in a fast and advisable way.<br/>  
Obviously also in this case with an adequate timing of the customer the shopkeeper can adequately follow the customer if necessary. Furthermore, a shopkeeper could only sell his products online saving the maintenance of the store.
